        <h4>Usage</h4>
        <p>Find a <a href="https://www.warcraftlogs.com/">WarcraftLogs</a> report you'd like to analyze, copy the URL (or just the report code) into the input box, and press the 'Get' button.</p>
        <p>Select the specific fight you'd like to analyze, and press the 'Analyze' button. Analysis may take up to a minute to complete.</p>

        <h4>Feral Druid Analysis</h4>
		<p><u>Expected AB Uptime</u></p>
		<p>Uses your actual ability cast times / targets to calculate your <i>expected</i> <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=210705/ashamanes-rip">Ashamane's Rip</a> uptime. Expected uptime is contrasted with actual uptime from logs. Results are presented for every enemy target you used Rip on. All uptimes are a percentage of the total fight time.</p>
		<p>The Ashamane's Bite artifact talent can be frustrating because while skill definitely contributes to uptime, the largest factor in an individual fight is pure luck. This analyzer seeks to remove luck from the equation when analyzing logs by letting you see your expected uptime based only on your ability timings.</p>
		<p>This analyzer should also allow you to rage at your poor proc luck, something which would no doubt otherwise be in short supply.</p>
		<p><b>SHORTCOMINGS: This analyzer is still <i>experimental</i>, and the code is a mess and needs to be refactored. Calculated Rip uptimes are very slightly off from the WCL reported values and I'm not sure why.</b></p>

        <h4>Resto Druid Analysis</h4>
		<p><u>Average Mastery Stacks</u></p>
		<p>Calculates the average number of mastery stacks you benefit from when healing. This average is weighted with respect to healing done (before mastery).</p>
		<p>The 'All Healing' entry counts the average over all your healing (and absorbs), even ones that don't benefit from Mastery like Ysera's Gift or Prydaz. This can give you a good feel for how much Mastery is contributing to overall healing done.</p>
		<p>The 'Druid Spells' entry counts the average only over the healing done by spells that can benefit from Mastery. This is likely the right number to enter into a spreadsheet for calculating stat weights.</p>
		<br>
		<p><u>Spell Mastery</u></p>
        <p>Calculates how much of your healing can be attributed to each of your HoT's mastery stacks. For example, if you took the talent <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=200390/cultivation">Cultivation</a>, healing from your <i>other</i> spells on a target with your Cultivation on it will heal for more because of the extra mastery stack provided by Cultivation. This is healing that wouldn't have happened had you not specced Cultivation, but it's completely invisible in basic logs. This analyzer seeks to remedy the issue.</p>
		<p>Results are presented as a percentage of your total healing done over the encounter, including from trinkets / legendaries. 'Direct' healing amounts should correspond to the numbers you see in the WCL report itself.</p>
        <p>Oh, and yes: <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=22842/frenzied-regeneration">Frenzied Regeneration</a> does count towards mastery for whatever reason.</p>
		<p><u>Mastery Procs</u></p>
		<p>Calculates healing attributable to certain mastery stacks, presented as a percentage of total healing. Current Mastery procs supported are the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=232378/astral-harmony">T19 2 piece bonus</a> and the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=224149/jacins-ruse">Jacin's Ruse set bonus.</a></p>
